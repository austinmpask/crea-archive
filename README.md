Archive of source code from Crea Roleplay.

I am uploading this only for my job search, this code has not been maintained since ~ 2021.

The bulk of my personal additions & modifications is scattered throughout:

    /gamemodes/VortexRoleplay.pwn

This script was originally a fork of Vortex RP -> (Moving Target Gaming RP), which I then forked to Crea Gaming/Crea Roleplay

To reiterate, **I did not create this from scratch**. You will find mentions of other individuals throughout the monolith source. **I forked my own version and made modifications and additions throughout many of the game's components for my server, Crea Gaming/Crea Roleplay.**

Due to the age of this project, I was only able to track down one older version of the VortexRoleplay.pwn, which I included in the initial commit, and overwrote in my second commit. This shows some (very, very) minor modifications I had made during one update. Again, my backups of these files is very limited, and those are the only 2 versions I could track down 3-4 years later. I believe this was the last backup I made on my own system before the codebase was moved to a private repo, once I had additional help, to which I do not have access anymore.

Being that this project went defunct in 2021, this is what I have been able to recover from my own files.
